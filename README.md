# 📝 API Countries Version-5

## 📌 Description

I created an app that allows users to look at and save different countries., with data about each country. Information includes country flag, population, and size.

I built this app for a class assignment.

## ✨ Features

I built the Saved Countries page that allows the user to save countries in a list. Each country has a description card that displays the country's iformation. On the home page. The Saved countries page has a form to gather users information.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I used HTML, REACT, CSS, Javascript to build the front end. I used Neon and SQL to build to my database. I used Node js Express Postman Render to build the API.

## 💭 Reflections

I learned to filter through data by using a map method.

I am proud of the flags that renders. They help the page look nicer.

It was very difficult to create the saved countries list. I had to create an array prior to saving the information.
